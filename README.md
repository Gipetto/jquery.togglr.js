# jQuery Togglr Plugin

Notice: This plugin was written in 2013. With the state of modern browser features this plugin is overkill. A few lines of vanilla javascript and some css can take the place of this plugin. Figure it out. You'll be glad you did.

For now, see http://gipetto.github.io/jquery.togglr.js/ for more details and a working sample page.
